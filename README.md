# CodeClause_CreditCardFraudDetection

Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for credit card fraud detection. The model utilizes historical credit card transaction data to identify fraudulent transactions accurately. By using advanced machine learning algorithms, the model can learn patterns and anomalies in the data to make predictions on whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of credit card transactions, labeled as either fraudulent or legitimate. It contains various features such as transaction amount, time, and anonymized features derived from the original transaction data.

Please note that the dataset is not included in this repository due to its sensitive nature. However, you can obtain a similar dataset from various sources, such as Kaggle or your organization's data repository.
